1. In array problems, **if you find a solution**, then try to find the **optimal solution**.


2. In array problems, optimal solutions mostly use:
    - **Frequency Array** (if constraints are limited)
    - **HashMap**
    - **Mathematical/Calculation-based Method**
    - **Prefix Sum / Suffix Sum Arrays**
    - **Sorting + Binary Search**
    - **Two Pointers / Sliding Window**

> âœ… So, try to apply the above three methods one by one to figure out the optimal solution.

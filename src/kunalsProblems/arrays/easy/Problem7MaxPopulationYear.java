            ----------
            The idea is to:

            Simulate population changes in chronological order by looking at when people are born and when they die.

            üîç Why Sort Separately?
            You're breaking down the problem into two separate timelines:

            1. One for birth events
            2. One for death events

            By sorting both:

            # You can process births and deaths in order (like merging two timelines).
            # This allows you to simulate how the population evolves year by year ‚Äî without explicitly iterating over every single year (which is useful when year range is large or unknown).

            üîÅ Intuition for the Two Pointers
            * birthPointer ‚Üí moves forward as new people are born
            * deathPointer ‚Üí moves forward as people die before the next birth

            IMPORTANT NOTE:
            ===============
            At each step:

            1. Before a birth year is processed, check if someone already died (death[deathPointer] <= birth[birthPointer]).
            2. If yes, decrement current population.
            3. You're cleaning up old lives before adding a new one.
            4. Add the new person being born.
            5. Check if population is the highest so far, and if yes, update the result.

            This mimics real life: before someone is born in a year, people who already passed away are no longer counted.

         */
        int[] birth = new int[logs.length];
        int[] death = new int[logs.length];

        for(int i = 0; i < logs.length; i++) {
            birth[i] = logs[i][0];
            death[i] = logs[i][1];
        }

        Arrays.sort(birth);
        Arrays.sort(death);

        int year = 0;
        int lives = 0;
        int maxLives = 0;

        int birthPointer = 0, deathPointer = 0;
        while(birthPointer < birth.length) {
            while(deathPointer < birthPointer && death[deathPointer] <= birth[birthPointer]) {
                lives--;
                deathPointer++;
            }

            lives += 1;
            if(lives > maxLives) {
                year = birth[birthPointer];
                maxLives = lives;
            }

            birthPointer++;

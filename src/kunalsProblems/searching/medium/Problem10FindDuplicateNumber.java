        ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Pigeonhole principle guarantees duplication

         There are n + 1 values but only n distinct numbers (1..n) available.
        ðŸ‘‰ At least one number repeats. Call it D.

        So two different indices i and j (with i â‰  j) satisfy:
        nums[i] = nums[j] = D


        ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Graph structure

        Think of this as a functional graph:
        * Each index has exactly one outgoing edge (because nums[i] is a single number).
        * Multiple indices can point to the same next index.

        Because of the duplicate:
        * Two arrows go into the same node (D).
        * From that node forward, the path must eventually repeat (since the graph is finite and deterministic).

        Thus â†’ a cycle exists.

        ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Why the cycle is unavoidable

        Letâ€™s follow from index 0:
        * Since nums[i] âˆˆ [1, n], you can never "fall off" the array.
        * With n + 1 steps, by the pigeonhole principle again, you must revisit some index.
        * The moment you revisit, youâ€™ve entered a cycle.

        So the traversal is guaranteed to end up looping.

        ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Why the duplicate = cycle entry

        * The duplicate value D is exactly the first index where two different arrows merge.
        * From then onward, youâ€™re trapped in a loop.
        So: Duplicate value = entry point of the cycle.

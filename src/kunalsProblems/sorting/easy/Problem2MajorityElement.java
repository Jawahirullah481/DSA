        Problem Restated
        ----------------

        Weâ€™re given an array nums and need to find the element that appears more than âŒŠ n/2 âŒ‹ times.

        * By definition, there is always exactly one majority element in the input.

        Naive Ideas (before optimal)
        ----------------------------

        * HashMap / Counting: Count frequency of each element â†’ O(n) time, O(n) space.
        * Sorting: Sort the array â†’ the majority element must be at the middle index â†’ O(n log n) time.
          âœ… Works, but not optimal.

        Key Insight ðŸ’¡
        --------------

        * If an element is the majority element (> n/2 occurrences), it will outnumber all other elements combined.
        * So if you start "cancelling out" different elements, the majority element will still remain at the end.

        Step-by-Step Intuition of Boyerâ€“Moore
        -------------------------------------

        * Think of it like a vote system.
        * num = candidate, count = balance of votes.
        * Start with the first element as the candidate.
        * Traverse the array:
          * If the current element is the same as num, increase count (more support).
          * If itâ€™s different, decrease count (opposition cancels one vote).
          * If count drops to 0, we "reset" â†’ pick the current element as a new candidate.
            (Because so far, equal number of candidate and non-candidate votes have cancelled out.)
        * By the end, the candidate num will be the majority element, because it couldnâ€™t be completely cancelled out.
